# Markers:
- Mouse MDSCs: 
  - Shared with Monocytes: CD11b+Ly6G−Ly6Chi; CD115 (CSF1R), CCR2 and CD49d (VLA4); F4/80 (pan-macrophage); 
  - CD115 and IL-4R (CD124); correlates with immunosuppressive activity; both markers are common on Mo-MDSCs found in tumors. 
  - CD49d (VLA4) is a useful marker for discriminating between Mo-MDSCs and granulocytic MDSCs.
  - CD84; discriminate between Mo-MDSCs and classical monocyte
  - immature Mo-MDSCs express PECAM-1 (CD31) as well as low levels of MHCII.
- Human MDSCs:
  - CD14 and CD15
  - human Mo-MDSCs can be distinguished from human monocytes(high) by HLA-DR expression.
  - CD66b−, CXCR1+, and CD84+
  - expressed nonuniformly across human Mo-MDSCs: CD11c (ITGAX), CXCR2, CD13, CD16lo, CD33, CD34, CD38, and Integrin α4β1 (ITGA4).
  - early-stage Mo-MDSCs are negative for the lineage markers CD14, CD15, CD3, CD19, and CD56
- M1/M2:
  - M1 by IFNG, TNF, and toll-like receptors; IL1a, IL1b, IL6, NOS2, TLR2, TLR4, CD80, and CD86. 
  - M2: IL4, IL10, and IL13; CD115, CD206, PPARG, ARG1, CD163, CD301, Dectin-1, PDL2, and Fizz1.
  - TAM(tumor-associated): CCR2, CSF1R, MARCO, PDL2, CD40, CCL2, CSF1, CD16 and PDGF beta.

- Human monocytes:
  - CD14, CD16（FCGR3A）
    - classical (CD14++CD16-) 
    - non-classical (CD14+CD16++) 
    - intermediate (CD14++CD16+)
- Mouse Monocytes:
 - Classic: Ly-6Chigh, CCR2high, CX3CR1low
 - non-classical: Ly-6Clow, CCR2low, CX3CR1high
